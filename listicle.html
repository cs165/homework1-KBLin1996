  <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytesand I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup.Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water.The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drinkthat doesn't have caffeine or milk.</p>

  <p><b>Recommendation:</b> Raspberry Italian soda</p>
